# OmnitureClient
This gem integrates Omniture SiteCatalyst into your web app. 

## Installation
    gem install omniture_client

## Omniture on Rails
This gem provides the ability to track a Rails application at the controller level. I prefer a completely sever-side implementation as opposed to using Omniture's s_code.js. This gem supports using both; however, the majority of the examples will be for a completely 

### File Structure
You create reporters in 'app/reporters' directory, which correspond to your controllers. The example I will use is a `MoviesController`. Omniture client will first attempt to use `MoviesReporter`. If you have not defined the `MoviesReporter`, then it will use the `BasicReporter`, which is what all controllers that do not have any special functionality should use. If you have not yet defined a `BasicReporter`, then it will use a stub that tracks nothing. You will pretty much always at least want a basic reporter, and for controllers that need to track special events or custom variables you should use a custom reporter.

    rails_project/
    ../app
    ..../reporters
    ..../movies_reporter.rb
    ..../basic_reporter.rb
    ../config
    ..../omniture.yml


### Configuration
You must configure the Omniture namespace, suite(s), version that you wish to use. Optionally, you can set up aliases to make things easier for yourself when coding reporters. Omniture uses `c1`, `e1`, `r`, etc to represent custom variables, e_vars, the referrer, etc. These param names are obscure and can be hard to remember so you can set up aliases for them. From the example below `movie_title` repersents custom varibale 2 (`c2`).

    # config/omniture.yml
    development:
      base_url: http://102.112.2O7.net
      ssl_url: https://102.112.2O7.net
      suite: suite1
      version: G.4--NS
      aliases:
        search_term: c1
        movie_titles: e1
        referrer: r

As well as the omniture.yml you need to also add the `app/reporters` directory to your load path. So in your enviroment file add the 2 following lines:

    # config/enviroment.rb
    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
      config.load_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/app/reporters )
      config.gem "omniture_client"
    end

Lastly, you need to specify which of your controllers you want to track. In most cases you will want to track all controllers so add this line to your application controller:

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      reports_to_omniture
    end

### View
The view code is straight foward. This is img tag is what actually sends the information to Omniture. It should probably be the last element in the body tag.
    
    # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
    <html>
      <head>...</head>
      <body>
        ....
        <img style='display:none' src="<%= @controller.omniture_url %>">
      </body>
    </html>

### Controller
Here is an example of a controller we would like to track:
    # app/controller/movies_controller.rb
    class MoviesController < ApplicationController
			
    # Uncomment the next line if it is not in your application controller
    # reports_to_omniture

      def index
        @movies = Movie.all
      end

      def show
        @movie = Movie.find(params[:id])
      end

      def search
        @keyword = params[:keyword]
        @movies = Movie.search(@keyword)
      end
    end

### Reporter
Reporters have access to all controller instance variables and methods. Below we use the `@movie` instance variable and `request` instance method which are from the controller instance. Also, be aware of the omniture.yml configuration, `:search_term` and `movie_titles` are aliases specific to this movies example. In your app you will want to use `c1` and `c2` or set up your own aliases in your omniture.yml. 

    class MoviesReporter < OmnitureClient::Base
      var :pageName do 
        page_name = "Movie Page"
      end

      # We can use any instance methods from the controller, here we use the `request` method
      var :r do
        request.referrer
      end

      # trigger event5 if user is doing a search and trigger event6 if movie is R rated
      var :events do
        events = []
        events << 'event5' if action_name == 'search' && @keyword
        events << 'event6' if action_name == 'show' && @movie.rating == "R"
        events
      end

      var :search_term do
        @keyword if action_name == 'search'
      end    
      
      # list prop that is delimited by |
      var :movie_titles, '|' do
        @movies.map{ |movie| movie.title } if action_name == 'index'
      end
    end

The `pageName` param is an extremely important param, the most important in fact. The `r` param which represents the referrer is also very important. The page name will default the the URL if you do not specify it, which is probably what you do not want. For the purposes of simiplicity I made the page name simple but in reality you will want it to be something like this:

    var :pageName do 
      case action_name
        when 'show' : "Movie - #{@movie.title}"
        else 'index' : "Movie List Page"
      end
    end

That is it to get the basics up and running with Rails.

## Additional Information

### Server-side events

Sometime there is a need to track events or other custom variables on the server side. To do this Omniture provides a SOAP API, however, I preferred an alternative method. I preferred to use Rails' flash to store the custom event or variable and append it to the img tag on the next page load. Here is an example of tracking a successful movie creation as an Omniture event (`event7`).

    # app/controller/movies_controller.rb
    class MoviesController < ApplicationController
      def new
        @movie = Movie.new
      end      

      def create
        @movie = Movie.new(params[:movie])
        if @movie.save
          flash[:notice] = 'Movie was successfully created.'
          omniture_flash[:events] = 'event7'        
          redirect_to(@movie)
        else
          render :action => "new"
        end
      end
    end


## Omniture Client for Sinatra (or other ruby web framework)
This gem works with any ruby web framework. However, some of the functionality like server-side tracking is only implemented for Rails. Here is an example using Omniture Client to track a Sinatra app.

    # application.rb
    require 'omniture_client'

    OmnitureClient.config({
      :base_url => 'http://102.112.2O7.net',
      :ssl_url => 'https://102.112.2O7.net',
      :suite => 'suite1',
      :version=> 'G.4--NS',
      :aliases => {
        'search_terms' => 'c1'
      }
    })

    helpers do
      def reporter
        SinatraReporter.new(self)
      end
    end

    get '/' do
      @title = "home"
      haml :index
    end

    class SinatraReporter < OmnitureClient::Base
      var :pageName do
        @title
      end
    end

You will also need to render the img tag in your views since this is the bit that actually sends the request to Omniture.

    # view/index.html.haml
    %img{ :style => 'display:none', :src => reporter.url }
    


## Javascript Implementation
A javascript implementation is slightly more obstrusive; however, there are a few extra reports you get access to in the Omniture web tool (ie. click map). So all the server-side code remains the same except for the the variable names. For example, instead of `c1` we use `s.prop1`. To have a javascript implementation, you also have to remove the img tag from your layout and add the reporter variables to the s_code.js. I will use a RJS for this example but you could can handle it a number of ways.

    # config/omniture.yml
    development:
      base_url: http://102.112.2O7.net
      ssl_url: https://102.112.2O7.net
      suite: suite1
      version: G.4--NS
      aliases:
        search_term: prop1
        movie_titles: e_var1

### Javascript
Here are the following script tags you will need. If you includes these DO NOT render the img tag shown in the examples above.

    <script language="javascript" src="//INSERT-DOMAIN-AND-PATH-TO-CODE-HERE/s_code.js"></script> 
    <script language="javascript"> 
      //<![CDATA[
        <% @controller.reporter.vars.each do |var| %>
          s.<%= var.name %>="<%= var.value %>";
        <% end %>
        s.t();
      //]]>
    </script>
